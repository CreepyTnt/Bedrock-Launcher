# Bedrock-Launcher
A launcher for Minecraft Bedrock on windows that has add-on and world management, and automatic backups. 
Bedrock Launcher is based on [Bedrock tools](https://github.com/CreepyTnt/Bedrock-tools) 

# Bedrock Launcher only works on windows 10/11

# Installation

### Python is required to run Bedrock Launcher. Python isn't pre installed with Windows so you will have to install it from [here](python.org/downloads)
Download and run "Bedrock Launcher Installer.py" as administrator. Without administrator permissions, the installer cannot create a desktop shortcut, however, you can also create a shortcut manually to "C:\Bedrock\ui.py".     

During installation, you will be prompted to install [fov changer](https://github.com/xroix/MCBE-Win10-FOV-Changer). Fov changer is a free, open source zoom mod for Minecraft Bedrock written in Python. You can use the bedrock launcher to launch fov changer along-side the actuall game. (I did not make fov changer, please report problems with fov changer to [the creator](https://github.com/xroix).

### Automatic Backups
To use automatic backups, simply download the "bedrock_startup.py" and put it in your startup folder ([windows key] + "r", type: "shell:startup")
